                                <p>Follow the below steps to identify trading companies on Alibaba</p>
                                <button type="button" class="btn btn-success" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#blog1">Read More</button>
								  <div id="blog1" class="collapse">
									<ul>
										<li>1) If a company is displaying too many different product categories on their Alibaba/website, then most probably they are a trading company.</li>
										<li>2) Check if their Business license copy which usually is in Chinese has mentioned them to be a trading company or not.</li>
										<li>3) Check if their address is in an industrial area. A local Chinese company too can help you in finding this.</li>
										<li>4) Is the company welcoming your request to visit their factory and are they open to inspections? If yes, that is a positive sign they are the actual manufacturer themselves.</li>
										<li>5) Do they reply to your inquiries quickly? Sometimes a trading company takes longer to respond because they have to check the prices and details from the actual manufacturer.</li>
										<li>6) Add their WeChat, and try to find clues in their WeChat moments (page) to see if they have pictures of their factory in it.</li>
										<li>7) Check their city and address and try sourcing other suppliers nearby or ask their competitors if they are a trading company or factory.</li>
										<li>8) Use a Sourcing company to do your due diligence.</li>
										<li>9) Compare their pricing to other suppliers. Remember, manufacturers should supply for a 10% to 40% cheaper price than trading companies.</li>
										<li>10) Ask for a live video call and request them to show you their manufacturing premises.</li>
										<li>11) Try contacting the Sales, Sales Manager, and boss of the company and talk to all of them to find out more about their company.</li>
										<li>12) Ask them if they have a 1688.com website. If yes, then there is a higher possibility that they are a manufacturer because the 1688.com website normally lists down only manufacturers. Trading companies also don't opt for it as the selling price is lower on this website.</li>
										<li>13) Ask them several questions about your product in detail (manufacturing process, packaging, production time, pricing, Moqs) and see if they have a deeper knowledge of their products. Sometimes trading companies deal with so many products that they don't have deep knowledge about the products they are selling. A good Manufacturer, on the other hand, would try to educate you about your product thoroughly.</li>

									<ul>
										<li>1) Better pricing (anywhere between 1 to 30% depending on the product and circumstances).</li>
										<li>2) Consistency in product quality.</li>
										<li>3) A lot of time that is required to communicate through a trading company is saved. Also, no mediator means fewer chances of misunderstandings happening which speeds up the product delivery process.</li>
										<li>4) Fewer chances of your product idea being copied/stolen because the number of companies involved in your project lessens by 1.</li>
										<li>5) It allows sellers to form a closer relationship with manufacturers. Eventually, you get to go on a visit which turns good in terms of better pricing, payment, new product ideas and you also get to learn about the actual manufacturing/supply chain process.</li>
										<li>6) In the case of a supplier messing up the quality of a large order, you can always have a better chance to fix that problem or get a refund when dealing directly with a manufacturer.</li>

                                <p>Usually, it's best to work with a manufacturer for any given product..</p>

									<ul>
										<li>but sometimes it's very hard for you to source from the manufacturer. This is why you might have to go through a trading company that provides you the products based on all your requirements, quality standard, and target pricing.</li>
										<li>So, it’s often a good idea to have an open mind and many times things can work out for both parties even when working with a trading company. Below are some of the benefits of working with a good & reliable trading company.</li>
										<li>1) Many trading companies spend on recruiting a strong sales team who are often quite motivated, enthusiastic, and quick to respond to all your requests. Also, an export-focused trading company’s sale team has a good command of the English Language.</li>
										<li>2) They can help in getting lower MOQs and even better pricing for your product because they buy in bulk or sometimes they have a strong past relationship with a manufacturer for that product. Many big trading companies also actually invest money in a factory but leave the daily operations to the manufacturer itself.</li>
										<li>3) You can source other products from them if the first few go well in terms of packaging, bundling, sample consolidation, warehousing, inspections, and shipping. If you manage to find a reliable trading company you could also work with them on a long-term basis for all these services so that you don't have to go through different companies.</li>
										<li>4) Your reliable trading company can vet other manufacturers whom you have sourced.</li>
										<li>5) Some traders are quite strong financially and even have a service of giving 20 to 60 Days credit terms to Amazon sellers. However, you need to do business with these traders initially and they should find you enough trustworthy to pay them back on time.</li>
										<li>6) Many trading companies give the sellers an option sending payments either by PayPal, Payoneer, or Trade Assurance.</li>

								<ul>
									<li>a) Why should we work with a sourcing company? Often throughout my working years in China, I have been asked this question by Clients/Buyers/Amazon sellers (New and Experienced ones both).</li>
									<li>b) They ask questions like - Why work with a sourcing company? What are the Pros and Cons? Is it worth our time? How much are the fees/commission? And yes, as any good business service provider would do, I try to give them as much information as possible.</li>
									<li>c) I would like to flesh out my thoughts on the topic based on my experience in dealing with different buyers/sellers from all around the world and from my experience of starting my sourcing company in China. First of all, let’s answer the below question.</li>
									<li>d) What exactly is a Sourcing Company?</li>
									<li>e) Any good sourcing company would provide the below Services.</li>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<li>1) Source the right product and a good reliable supplier for the client.</li>
									<li>2) Negotiate the best possible prices and arrange samples to the client.</li>
									<li>3) Make full detailed contracts with all the terms and conditions stated clearly both to the supplier and client. The contracts include payment terms, required Certifications, delivery date, packaging/labels, etc.</li>
									<li>4) If necessary, visit the supplier before confirming the order to check their reliability, capabilities, an confirm whether they are a manufacturer or trading company.</li>
									<li>5) Follow up with the suppliers during the production of the goods.</li>
									<li>6) Inspector gets the goods inspected for quality control before the shipment.</li>
									<li>7) Arrange the shipment of the Goods with the best shipping prices and speed either by air or sea. Also, provide all the documentation																					to clients so that they can clear the goods from their local customs.</li>
									<li>8) If there is more than one product and supplier, then coordinate with the factories to club the goods together for shipment. </li>
									<li>9) Even after your clients receive the goods, provide after service to them and tend to their other needs and requirements.</li>

                                <button type="button" class="btn btn-success" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#blog5">Read More</button>
								<div id="blog5" class="collapse">
								<ul>
									<li>a) Yes, 1688.com is a pretty useful website for sourcing products from China. It's in many ways the Chinese Version of Alibaba and is owned by Alibaba. Alibaba is focused on the international market and hence is branded to suit the international market which makes it popular. It's more expensive for a company to register and have a presence on the Alibaba Platform (at times nearly USD5000 for a year).</li>
									<li>b) Hence sometimes the pricing on Alibaba can be on the higher side because manufactures and trading companies also have to invest more in hiring a Local English-speaking sales team and be a more export-focused business.</li>
									<li>c) However, the Alibaba suppliers do have a presence on 1688.com. While focusing on the Chinese local market to find suppliers with lower pricing and lower MOQs they also want to do business with sourcing and trading companies who often use 1688.com.</li>
									<li>d) Sometimes the same supplier on Alibaba selling a product for say $2 to the international market lists that same product for $1.5 or lower on the 1688.com website.</li>
									<li>e) On 1688.com a lot of the smaller and even bigger manufactures based in China have some sort of presence and the cost of having a presence on 1688.com is very low and at times close to Zero. Yes, there are still quite a few trading companies doing business on 1688.com but compared to Alibaba there are fewer.</li>
									<li>f) The whole 1688.com website is in Chinese, so a lot of sellers have to use tools like Google Translate to navigate through the website to get some more ideas on the Actual China market price. So, they try to add a suppliers WeChat App and communicate through it as it has an inbuilt translation software in it.</li>
									<li>g) However, it takes some time, is tedious, and can be frustrating at times due to language issues, different time zones, etc. Also, there’s always a risk of things getting lost in translation and the chances of screwing up the whole project become high.</li>
									<li>h) Many times the supplier on 1688.com happens to have an English speaking staff and some factory owners take help from a friend in translations/communications for certain projects so that they don't lose business!</li>
									<li>i) Using a local sourcing company or trading company to help you source from 1688.com for better pricing, lower MOQs without compromising on the quality can also be a good idea.</li>
									<li>j) However, you should never depend on these companies a lot but involve in the process from the beginning and keep things transparent as much as possible. This way you can be aware of the pricing, supplier contact information, shipping costs, production process, and will understand how things work in the supply chain.</li>

								<ul>
                                <li>- You don’t want to go in with a counteroffer so low that would make the supplier think either you are not serious, unprofessional or a total newbie.</li>
                                <li>- You must know the average price first of your product, in the country you are sourcing from. That will give you an idea of how much realistically you can negotiate without making your supplier lose interest in your inquiry.</li>
                                <li>- To put it simply, say you have a lemonade stand where you are selling each glass for $3.00 (your sales are reasonably good at this price) and if someone comes up to you and says they will pay you $0.30 for one glass, you would most likely feel this person is not even worth your time. Hence, negotiating with them will not help and you would most likely not budge from your $3.00 price.</li>
                                <li>- Price is very important of course but it's best to not focus on that as in China many suppliers will give you what you pay for. Meaning you could end up with a very low-quality product based on your low negotiated price. I have been a victim of this where I initially felt quite proud of myself of managing to negotiate a very low price but later suffered when the final goods produced were of poor quality. Though at the very same time you do want to get the best possible price for your product and ideally which is lower than your competitors</li>
                                <li>- Before you start negotiating the price with your supplier, it's best if you can get multiple quotes from at least half a dozen suppliers and understand the average price and why is one suppliers’ price higher/lower than others. This will give you an overall better understanding of your product and how would it be possible for the price to come down without compromising on the quality of the product.</li>
                                <li>- Below are a few of the things you can say to your supplier during the price Negotiation period:</li>
